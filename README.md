# Hiring Assistant Chatbot

## Project Overview

The Hiring Assistant Chatbot is an intelligent conversational agent designed to streamline and automate the candidate screening and interview process. It can interact with candidates, ask relevant questions, analyze responses, and provide scoring to assist hiring managers in making informed decisions. The chatbot leverages advanced language models to understand context, generate questions, and evaluate answers, making the hiring process more efficient and consistent.

## API Details

This project requires several external APIs for its core functionality. You must obtain API keys and configure them in your `.env` file:

- **Google Generative AI (Gemini) API**

  - **Purpose:** Used for generating interview questions, analyzing candidate responses, and scoring answers using advanced language models.
  - **Key:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
  - **Where to get:** [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)


- **Mailjet API**
  - **Purpose:** Sending thank-you or notification emails to candidates after interview completion.
  - **Keys:** `MAILJET_API_KEY` and `MAILJET_API_SECRET`
  - **Where to get:** [Mailjet Account](https://app.mailjet.com/account/api_keys)

Add these keys to your `.env` file as follows:

## Technical Details

- **Libraries Used:**
  - `gemini` (for LLM integration)
  - `streamlit` (for web interface, if applicable)
  - `python-dotenv` (for environment variable management)
  - `mailjet` (for email notifications)
  - Other standard Python libraries
- **Model Details:**
  - Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Architecture:**
  - Modular design with separate components for context management, intent analysis, scoring, session handling, and email service.
  - JSON-based storage for candidate data.

## Prompt Design

Prompts are carefully crafted to:

- Gather relevant candidate information (background, skills, experience).
- Generate technical and behavioral questions dynamically based on context.
- Ensure clarity, neutrality, and fairness in question phrasing.
- Adapt follow-up questions based on previous answers.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Ensuring accurate intent recognition and context retention across multi-turn conversations.
  - **Solution:** Implemented a robust context handler and session manager to track conversation state and candidate progress.
- **Challenge:** Generating relevant and non-repetitive questions.
  - **Solution:** Designed dynamic prompt templates and used candidate data to tailor question generation.
- **Challenge:** Handling ambiguous or incomplete candidate responses.
  - **Solution:** Added fallback mechanisms and clarification prompts to guide candidates.
